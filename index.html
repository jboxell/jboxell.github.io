    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jada Boxell. I’m from West Linn, Oregon, and I’m currently a freshman at the University of Oregon studying business. My favorite subject is math! I love skiing, hiking, horseback riding, shopping, swimming, paddle boarding, road tripping, reading, and exploring. I enjoy spending time with my friends, family, and animals. I’m a huge animal lover and spend most of my time volunteering at shelters, working with abused animals, and helping rehabilitate them as therapy animals. I’m passionate about what I do and love talking about it!</p>
